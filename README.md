# RSA-Implementation
RSA, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, is pivotal in modern cryptography. It encrypts data using public and private keys, securing sensitive information like passwords and transactions. Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in digital communication, RSA plays a crucial role in today's interconnected world.

## Features
- RSA key generation for various key lengths (1024, 2048, 4096 bits).
- Encryption and decryption of messages using RSA.
- Support for both traditional RSA decryption and RSA decryption **with** and **without** CRT(chinease random theorem).
- Performance measurement for RSA encryption, decryption, and key generation.
- Security against side-channel attacks and fault injection.

## Performance Measurement
Performance measurements are included to evaluate the efficiency of RSA encryption, decryption, and key generation for different key lengths. Run the provided script and review the output to analyze performance metrics
